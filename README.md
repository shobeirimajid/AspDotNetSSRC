# Displaying SSRS Reports in ASP.NET Core MVC Web Applications

Embed **SSRS** (SQL Server Reporting Services) report into **MVC Web App**.

**ReportViewer** is a server control and **server controls** were generally designed with **web forms**
 
Microsoft package **"Microsoft.Reporting.WebForm"** is a solution for utilizing the **ReportViewer** Control in a Web Forms.

Unfortunately, **ASP.NET MVC** does not support Web Forms, so ReportViewer control is not going to work there.

With absents of "Microsoft.Reporting.WebForm" in ASP.NET MVC, displaying SSRS reports in **ASP.NET MVC** Web App is a challenging topic for many developers. 

Microsoft has not release **SSRS viewer** for **ASP.NET MVC** yet. We hope, Microsoft support web forms for **ASP.NET MVC** and integrate **SSRS** report into **ASP.NET MVC** web app in the future.

This package does not work with asp.net core. 
It internally hosts the webform control and calls itâ€™s render. 
As **webform controls** are not supported on **.netcore** this will not work.
To host type the SSRS control, you need a **.net framework 4.x** website.
The **asp .net core** site can use an **iframe** or **link to the SSRS** site.

It should be possible to update the MvcReportViewer to proxy a call to the SSRS site instead of hosting the actual control.
