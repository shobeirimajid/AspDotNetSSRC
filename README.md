# Displaying SSRS Reports in ASP.NET Core MVC Web Applications

Microsoft package **"Microsoft.Reporting.WebForm"** is a solution for utilizing the **ReportViewer** control in Web Forms.
Unfortunately, **ASP.NET Core** does not support Web Forms, so ReportViewer control is not going to work there.

With absents of "Microsoft.Reporting.WebForm" in ASP.NET Core, displaying SSRS reports in **ASP.NET Core MVC** Web App is a challenging topic for many developers. I hope, Microsoft will support web forms for ASP.NET Core in the future.
